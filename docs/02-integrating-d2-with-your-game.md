## How to Integrate D2

Below is an overview of how D2 rewards can be incorporated into your game.

### Integrate D2 With Your Existing Currencies

Your in-game currencies are valuable to all players, making them ideal for integration. This connection can also encourage increased spending as players visit your store to convert their steps into rewards.

- Steps can be exchanged for an existing game currency at a controlled rate.
- Steps can modify or boost currency earning/spending. For example:
  - Meeting a step goal provides an **X% boost** to currency earned that day.
  - Step goals unlock **discounts on in-game purchases**.

### Integrate D2 With Your Item Economy

Individual rewards can be more persuasive than general ones. D2 integration allows you to spotlight specific gameplay elements and engage targeted player groups.

- Steps can **gate access** to specific items by requiring a step goal before purchasing them with in-game currency.

- Steps can **convert to XP** or act as a multiplier.
- Steps can **accelerate battle pass progress**.
- Steps can **reduce cooldowns** (e.g., crafting time, companion healing, pet XP, or secondary mechanics).

## Designing for Healthy Habits

Building long-term habits ensures sustainable health benefits for players. Here are some design considerations:

### Challenging Rewards Hit Harder
- Players value **earned rewards** more than those given freely.
- Example: Congratulating players for meeting a personal fitness goal via D2 can be more engaging than sending random rewards.

### Goals Should Be Personalized and Specific
- Setting personalized fitness goals based on user data (e.g., age, height, weight) increases motivation.
- Example: Players who frequently start new characters could receive **XP boosters for alts** as a reward.

### Accountability Matters
- Social reinforcement in multiplayer environments enhances motivation.
- Example: Visible D2-related rewards let players show off their fitness progress to others.
- Example: NPCs or UI elements can **acknowledge player progress** or encourage further participation.

### Even Time Away From the Game Can Strengthen Player Engagement
- Meaningful integrations keep players connected even when they’re not actively playing.
- Example: A 20-minute walk translating into RPG XP reinforces a **positive link between movement and game progression**.

## Leveraging Crews and Community

D2 supports **group-based challenges** that recognize individual contributions while promoting collective goals.

### Crews
- Developer-created or player-managed groups that allow community members to work toward shared fitness milestones.
- Goals can be **fixed (total step count)** or **relative (X steps per crew member)**.

### Groups
- Players opt-in to supporting specific games or causes.
- Movement totals contribute to a **global leaderboard**.

### Faction and Crew Goals
- Community-based progress unlocks features, world narratives, or cooperative incentives.
- Example: If players **collectively walk the distance of the game world**, fast travel benefits unlock for all.
- Example: Players can "vote with their feet" by contributing steps toward conflicting faction goals.

### "Coopetition" (Cooperative Competition)
- Individual contributions to a faction or crew are **ranked**, fostering both cooperation and competition.
- Players who contribute the most steps can receive **special recognition or rewards**.
